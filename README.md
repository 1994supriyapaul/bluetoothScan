# bluetoothScan

You have to clone the project file and go to the master branch.
1. You get the BlueToothListViewController.swift  In this "TestNotification2\TestNotification2\View". Where  I scan and show all lists.
2. DeviceItem model is here "\TestNotification2\TestNotification2\Model"
3. ViewModel is here "TestNotification2\TestNotification2\ModelView".


   Open the app and you have to give Bluetooth permission or access to the app then. All the Bluetooth device lists show in a table view and you can select any device to click on any row. Then bluetooth device connects automatically and shows a connected alert. Error handle and print in the console.
